# dotfiles
Config I can use to replicate my setup on new machines

All files in here should go under ~/

Included config for:
- tmux
- nvim
- ssh
- bashrc

Additionally included some scripts that ties everything together

## Important note: Neovim with Ubuntu
See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim/688be28f98c18e73b5043879b5963287a9b13d6c
for instructions on building Neovim from source and creating a .deb package (See step 4 in quick start).
This is necessary because version 0.11.3 is needed for most of my setup.
